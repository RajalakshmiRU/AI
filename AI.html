        <p style="color: darkturquoise;font-size:20px;text-align: left;">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are 
            programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be
             applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as 
             learning and problem-solving.</p>
        <h1 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">Why is it important?</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">AI automates repetitive learning and 
            discovery through data.<br>AI adds intelligence to existing products<br>AI adapts through 
            progressive learning algorithms<br>AI analyzes more and deeper data using neural networks 
            that have many hidden layers.<br>AI achieves incredible accuracy through deep neural networks
             – which was previously impossible.<br></p>
        <h1 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">Challenges </h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">1. Computing Power<br>
            2. Trust Deficit<br>
            3. Limited Knowledge<br>
            4. Human-level<br>
            5. Data Privacy and Security<br>
            6. The Bias Problem<br>
            7. Data Scarcity</p>
        <h1 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">Types Of AI</h1>
        <h2 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">1. Reactive Machines</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">Reactive machines are the simplest level of robot. They cannot create memories or use 
            information learnt to influence future decisions – they are only able to react to presently 
            existing situations.<br>
            IBM’s Deep Blue, a machine designed to play chess against a human, is an example of this. 
            Deep Blue evaluates pieces on a chess board and reacts to them, based on pre-coded chess 
            strategies. It does not learn or improve as it plays – hence, it is simply ‘reactive’.<br></p>   
        <h2 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">2. Limited Memory</h2>  
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">A limited memory machine, as the name might suggest, is able to retain some information 
            learned from observing previous events or data. It can build knowledge using that memory in 
            conjunction with pre-programmed data. Self-driving cars for instance store pre-programmed 
            data – i.e. lane markings and maps, alongside observing surrounding information such as the 
            speed and direction of nearby cars, or the movement of nearby pedestrians.<br> 
            These vehicles can evaluate the environment around them and adjust their driving as 
            necessary. As technology evolves, machine reaction times to make judgements have also 
            become enhanced – an invaluable asset in technology as potentially dangerous as 
            self-driving cars. Improvements in machine learning also helps autonomous vehicles to 
            continue to learn how to drive in a similar way to humans – through experience over time.<br></p>
        <h2 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">3. Theory of Mind</h2>
        <img src="Sophia.jpg" alt="Robot Sophia" width="320px" height="325px" style="float: left;" >
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">Human beings have thoughts and feelings, memories or other brain patterns that drive and 
            influence their behaviour. It is based from this psychology that theory of mind researchers 
            work, hoping to develop computers that are able to imitate human mental models. That is
             – machines that are able to understand that people and animals have thoughts and feelings 
             that can affect their own behaviour.<br>
            It is this theory of mind that allows humans to have social interactions and form societies.
            Theory of mind machines would be required to use the information derived from people and 
            learn from it, which would then inform how the machine communicates in or reacts to a 
            different situation.<br>
            A famous but still very primitive example of this technology is Sophia, 
            the world-famous robot developed by Hanson Robotics, who often goes on press tours as 
            an ever-evolving example to the public of what robots are capable of doing. 
            Whilst Sophia is not natively able to determine or understand human emotion, she can hold 
            basic conversation and has image recognition and an ability to respond to interactions 
            with humans with the appropriate facial expression, as well as an incredibly human-like 
            appearance.<br>
            Researchers have yet to truly develop theory of mind technology however, with criticisms 
            of Sophia for instance being that she is simply “a chatbot with a face”.</p>
        <h2 style="color: aquamarine;text-align: center;">4. Self-awareness</h2>
        <p style="color:rgb(178, 248, 248);text-align:justify;font-size: 20px;">Self-awareness AI machines are the most complex that we might ever be able to envision and 
            are described by some as the ultimate goal of AI.
            These are machines that have human-level consciousness and understand their existence in the 
            world. They don’t just ask for something they need, they understand that they need something;
             ‘I want a glass of water’ is a very different statement to ‘I know I want a glass of water’.<br>
            
            As a conscious being, this machine would not just know of its own internal state but be 
            able to predict the feelings of others around it. For instance, as humans, if someone yells at 
            us we assume that that person is angry, because we understand that is how we feel when we
             yell. Without a theory of mind, we would not be able to make these inferences from other 
             humans.  
            Obviously, self-aware machines are, at present, a work of science fiction and not 
            something that exist – and in fact, may never exist. As it is, we’re probably best 
            focusing on the development of machine learning in our AI. A machine that has a memory, 
            that can learn from events in its memory and then can take that learning and apply 
            it to future decisions is the baseline of evolution in Artificial Intelligence. Developing 
            this will lead to AI innovation that could turn society on its head, enhance how we live
             in the day to day exponentially and even save lives.<br></p>
